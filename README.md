HOW TO RUN APPLICATION:
1) Run Application.java in BACKEND folder if you have not run it at least once. This will instantiate an application with dummy items and save it to textfile database.txt
This is how we are saving between sessions, and will help with testing since there will already be values. 
*OWNER INFO [email: Admin      password: 1234]
2) In order to run the application every subsequent time, open Restaurant.java and run it directly. IT'S ALREADY BEEN SET UP TO AUTOSAVE AND AUTOLOAD THE DATABASE AS LONG AS YOU'VE DONE STEP ONE, SO JUST RUN IT DIRECTLY.
